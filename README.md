Github repository for Error 404 for the Fall 2024 BMCC AI Innovation Challenge

PROJECT SUMMARY
-------------------
Our app is meant to be a general purpose wellness app that aids students with their physical, mental, and emotional health. 
- The physical section of the app focuses on the student's fitness goals. Here they can track their calories consumed/burned, heart rate, workout progress, and other relevant data. They can also get workout recommendations based on their height and weight and their overall fitness goals. The maintenance portion would remind the student to eat (and what they should be eating to meet nutrient goals), to workout (on days they should be going to the gym), and what their overall goals are.
- The mental/emotional sections of the app focus on the student's mental well being. Here they can speak with an AI chatbot about their daily activities and worries, and potentially ask for advice on what they can do to improve themselves and their lives. The chatbot would be constantly looking for certain keywords and/or phrases that could indicate that more immediate intervention is needed and guide the student appropriately to a mental health professional on or off campus or to emergency services. Students can also book appointments with campus mental health staff.
